      <p>Hi, my name is Nick, nice to meet you and thanks for looking at my webpage. While I totally can empathize with you if you think that this site doesn't look all that great but have faith in me, I'm trying my best. 
        So if you are interested in my background I'd be happy to divulge. I was born in New York on Long Island and lived there from age 0-19 then I attended college in upstate New York, returning to Long Island for breaks. </p>

      <p>  Following college, I moved home to my mom's house but soon after that I was able to rent my own apartment with a friend of mine from       middle school. During this time I worked at Stony Brook University as the catering operations manager. 
        After one year and two months, I moved to Denver, Colorado to work at the University of Denver as a Catering Supervisor. This was an unforeseen demotion in my career so I began attending the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp in order for a career change which is how you have ended up reading this bio!</p>
